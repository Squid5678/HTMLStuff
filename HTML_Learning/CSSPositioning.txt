Static Positioning:
- This is the default positioning scheme within HTML. 
- HTML just makes one item go after the other.

Relative Positioning:
- This is the position relative to the default position.
- You can specify a push from all 4 directions!

Absolute Positioning:
- Position everything relative to the nearest positioned ancestor! (think ancestor from combining selectors.)
- If no position property is set, it does everything relative to the top left corner of the webpage.
- Z-index: determines which elements goes on top of the other (in the z-direction). This is how you can 
get a layered effect with things. Things with a higher z-index will happen on top.

Fixed Positioning:
- Position relative to the top-left corner of the browser window. It will stay and never move. It does not move 
with the webpage (so even if you scroll down, it will still remain in place.)
