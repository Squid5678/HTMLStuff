CSS has inheritance-like qualities. These are the orders in which styles are assigned. 
- Position: in your CSS file, when you specify a style (either through ID, attribute, class name, etc.),
the one that is the furthest down in the CSS filue will be selected. 
- Specificity: you can be very general with CSS, or you can get very specific with an ID. 
In general, the most specific way of controlling an atrribute will be selected. 
- Type: Inline is the most specific, so it will override everything. This is then followed by 
internal CSS, then external CSS. 
- Importance: there is a keyword called !important that you can use that will override everything. 
Add a space after your style declaration, then add the keyword.

The above is a hierarchy. So the order of importance goes from 4 - 1.

NOTE: you can apply multiple classes to one element AS LONG AS you apply a SPACE between 
the names of the classes.
